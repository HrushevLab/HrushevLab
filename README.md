Hey-Hey, I Am Alex.
I'm a junior programmer. In 2021, I graduated from college with a degree in software engineering, and now I am ready to develop projects.

At the moment, I am fond of such languages:
PHP
Python
With #
HTML + CSS + JS

If you have an idea for a project, but you can't implement it yourself, you can write a proposal for cooperation by e-mail: a.s.hrushev@gmail.com.
